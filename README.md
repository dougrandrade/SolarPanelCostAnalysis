Basic R analysis to determine if electricity price trends over decades justify $40,000+ in solar panel investment.

Planned outline:
1. Visual analysis of avg U.S. city electricity monthly prices 1979-2023
    * impute missing values
    * time series ggplot(s)
3. Compare the lowest avg month and highest avg month

   * line or bar ggplot of number of activities over 1979-2023 (if able)
9. Compare Virginia electricity prices and economic factors to national statistics (of common-recorded years)
   * impute Virginia economic growth indicators
   * time series ggplot(s)
   * analysis of whether Virginia electric price trends trail, match, or exceed Virginia economic growth indicators
   * review analysis with time of Virginia's major energy initiatives
11. Forecast next 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years based on monthly and annual seasonality and adjusted of periodicity of U.S. energy initiative events.
